# NBA Project

This is a project designed to take salary data and player data and combine them into a large database.
This database can be used for several things including trying to predict the future salaries, as well as looking back throughout history to see what contracts were overvalued,
or which contracts should have been higher.

# Data Sources
I had two main sources in which I used web scraping techniques to get the data. My first was https://hoopshype.com/ this website contained all of the salary data that was needed to assemble the data set. The second was https://www.basketball-reference.com/ this website is the best site to gather any NBA staistic you can think of.
